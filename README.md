A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) CRUD application featuring complete frontend and backend validation, optimized database queries, and structured error handling.

On the backend, it includes a robust Express API connected to MongoDB using Mongoose, with features like:

Unique user validation (checks for duplicate email or name)

Clean error and success response structure

Reusable CRUD controllers for scalability

Proper RESTful route structure

On the frontend, React handles user interactions and form validation before submitting requests to the backend.

This project demonstrates the use of best practices in CRUD development, including:

Create: Adds new users with duplicate validation

Read: Fetches all users or a single user by ID

Update: Updates user details dynamically

Delete: Deletes users with clear confirmation responses

With future scalability in mind, the project supports adding pagination, filtering, and sorting easily, and can be extended for advanced CRUD features such as soft deletes, bulk operations, and authentication.
